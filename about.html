  <h1>2020 | URBAN IMPROVEMENT AND TRUST</h1>
  <p>Salmon Fund 501(3)c | Non-Profit Organization will impact the way we donate in the future, and .Fund Tokens are poised to play a leading role in this new era of fundraising. SMN Tokens are the newest private circulating ERC20 securities that aim to become the preferred method to donate transparently through the Ethereum blockchain. Using distributed ledgers to track transactions, cryptocurrencies to transfer funds and smart contracts to ensure donations are spent correctly, we are determined to make the nonprofit sector more transparent.</p>

  <p>Like Bitcoin, Ether is a digital bearer
  asset - similar to a security, like a bond or trust, issued in physical form. Just like cash, it does
  not require a third party to process or approve a transaction. Instead of operating as a digital
  currency or payment, Ether seeks to provide “fuel” for the decentralized applications on the
  network.</p>
<br/><br/>
  <p>
    Our app is the SMN token which acts as a public database for all our monetary transactions.
    When we issue a SMN token, it represents 10 cents on the USD. With 10 million in private
    circulation, these tokens are managed in digital wallets and, once distributed, the owner has full
    control of token management. When tokens are in private circulation, they cannot be
    manipulated and only one entity can distribute them from the source. The Salmon.Fund holds
    the source wallet with all 10 million tokens and contractually distributes them which creates a
    system of trust.

  When recording a transaction on the
  blockchain, a small amount of money is used as a transaction fee. Ether refers to the
  microtransaction as gas and it represents 1/10 of a cent per transaction depending on speed.
  Gas is paid to crypto-miners for the cost of replicating ledgers as an incentive for their part in the
  validation process.

  <br/><br/>

  The Salmon.Fund chose Ethereum because of its speed and the security of its smart
  contracts. The security of blockchain technology is its cloud-based database of all transactions,
  duplicated millions of times across thousands of computers by the crypto-miners providing a
  verification system using sheer numbers. Token amounts can never be manipulated and the
  network is unhackable to date. A digital wallet is the only required software needed to hold SMN
  tokens; for usability and ease of entry, we direct our participants to Metamask.

<br/><br/>

  All funds are distributed via Metamask in SMN tokens and withdrawals can be made after a request has been
  submitted and mailed via check to the withdrawers registered address. These requests can be
  in paper form or always accessible to the participant online at the Salmon.fund website.
  Annually the Salmon.fund performance will be evaluated based on project completion, material
  management, and participant withdrawal.

Participants having permanent housing is linked to the accumulation of SMN tokens, a warranty
deed, and Salmon.Fund properties. Micheal Salmon acts as the current owner of the house, the
"grantor," and the “grantee” refers to the participant or trustee of the trust. The consideration is
the amount of money paid for the transfer: $1 in the state of Kansas plus the square foot value
in SMN tokens. The property's legal description will feature the address of the permanent home
allocated to the participant. The deed will be notarized and, during the filing process at the
county recorder’s office, a transfer tax form along with other necessary forms will be completed
with the participant. The home will then be added to the trust agreement's property list with an
attached, certified copy of the deed to complete the trust. All fees are paid for by the
Salmon.fund.

<br/><br/>

As projects are completed, we will move qualified participants into our affordable homes at a
fixed rate rent. This rent will be paid to the Salmon.fund through SMN tokens. Metamask is a
mobile phone application designed to manage ether and ethereum tokens turning any mobile
device into a digital wallet. Tokens are protected using a 12 word passphrase only known to the
Participant and Salmon.fund for account support. Each Monday, tokens will be deposited into
the digital wallets of each participant based on recorded labor hours. Our strategy for long term
property maintenance begins here. Each participant that moves into our affordable homes will
be required to complete the SMN Token Agreement which contains parameters for rent
accumulation and the Home Ownership Agreement containing guidelines for property
maintenance.

<br/><br/>

Salmon.Fund 501(c)3 focuses on three (3) primary revenue streams:<br/>
- Rent Accumulation<br/>
- Grants<br/>
- Public/Private Donations<br/><br/>
On Dec 31st, all wallets holding SMN tokens will be given a 15% token increase based on total
wallet value. This revenue share is based on projected participant program failure rates and
partnership donations.
