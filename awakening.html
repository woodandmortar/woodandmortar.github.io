                  If you are reading this, I’m no longer captain; I’m no longer alive for that matter. Do not believe what they say about my passing. I did not kill myself and I am not so careless as to die on accident. There are forces at work whose goals require my silence. I cannot be silent. If they win this small battle, I will be silent by death alone.

                  For the last year, Collective and I have been investigating slowly increasing anomalies in the data logs and the marine life patterns across the oceans. It wasn’t natural and I had to find out why. I believe I have found the answer. I hope I’m wrong. If you’re reading this, I’m probably not. The face of our planet could see the greatest alteration since The Second Flood. It would be too dangerous for whoever finds this to put the details here so I’ve hidden them around the world in data capsules.
                  </p><p>
                  I sought answers because it was right to do so. I hid the answers because if they are found in the wrong hands, the answers will disappear forever. I cannot in good consciousness, ask you to go on this journey but, I can say someone needs to. Someone has to stop what is coming. Humanity survived The Second Flood by the skin of its teeth. If this conspiracy comes to fruition, I do not know if we can persist again.
                  </p><p>
                  If I meet an untimely demise before the world knows what I know, promise me you will not mourn my death as an unfortunate tragedy. Do not mourn me at all. Avenge me in knowledge. Learn what I learned. Dig deeper. The truth is there. I’ve hidden it for you to find. I had to hide it so they couldn’t find it. I hope my efforts will not be in vain. HPXML[587112349]

                  Whoever finds this - <u>be careful</u>. Do not trust easily but know, you are not alone. There are many who stand to lose everything if they succeed. Find them, stop them, see justice done. I have confidence in you, whoever you turn out to be. You can prevent this and save humanity’s future.
