                  Back and forth, back and forth. Your body rocks in silent, empty, blackness but the longer it goes on the more you realize it isn’t silent, empty, or black. Each sway brings a beep, rhythmic and calm but rousing. Each beep pulls you further from the sway. You aren’t in blackness, the orange-tinted black of the back of your eyelids tells you there is dim light behind your closed eyes. Your breathing is low and as you become aware of it, a burning dryness erupts in your throat and stretches up into your sinuses. Your body aches, heavy and sore almost weighing you down to the crisp, rough sheets on the bed you have to be on.

                  As you realize the sways have stopped and the beeping is your heartbeat coming through an EKG machine, you hear the rustling of someone in the room with you. A few papers flipping back and forth down by your feet precedes the rasp of soft shoes against the floor. Off your left, a drawer slides open, pauses, and slides closed again with a soft click. More lightly dragging footsteps to your bed. You have to be in a hospital somewhere. But where? You think to yourself. Thoughts. More than observations, you have inquisitions. Where am I? How did I get here? What was I doing before I was here? What happened to me? There had to be a before, but no matter how you stretch back into your memories, you return to the now with nothing more than foggy wisps of memories.

                  You can’t stay in this hospital bed ignoring your vast thirst, deeply aching body, and the rest of reality that comes with it forever. You have to do something.

                Your eyes burn but you need to get a handle on what is going on around you. Everything is pale, dim blurs around you for a few seconds before you blink your eyes into focus and confirm your assumption.You are in a hospital. The room is dimly lit by indeterminate daylight filters through the thick canvas blinds covering three windows  high on the wall to your right.
                Moving your head feels monumental but you shift to inspect to the left. It's a tiny room, just some cabinets and a sink by the door. The air is clean, crisp and smells like the familiar nothing of flawlessly purified indoor air. Comforting, but not helpful in determining where you are.
</p>
<p>
                “Good afternoon. I see you’ve woken up.”
</p>
<p>
                A young man with a warm face briefly makes eye contact before returning to his task at the monitoring station at the head of your bed. He gives you a moment to orient your thoughts, not that you can seem to find any from before your newfound consciousness. He is small and slender but moves confidently through the room. Instead of the standard sterilization smocks most medical professionals wear, he opted for a cuffed linen jogger and open cardigan. His black hair hangs long and casual around his face.</p>

                It is easy to feign sleep when your body feels this battered. You note the beep of your heart rate and regulate your now conscious breathing to maintain the same pace. Not moving and just allowing yourself to drift back to sleep feels like a much easier course of action. You can’t. You have to push through what you know will be your body’s aching protests. You’ve pushed through worse before; you can do this. When did I push through worse before? It felt right to think but you had no memory to back your thought up.
</p>
<p>
                You wait for the footsteps to leave your bedside and crack your eyes open just the tiniest bit. They burn and you have to breathe through the urge to massage your eyelids. Everything is pale, dim blurs around you for a few seconds before you blink your eyes into functioning and confirm your assumption.You are in a hospital. The room is dimly lit by daylight shining partially through the thick canvas blinds covering three windows set high on the wall to your right.
</p>
<p>
                Moving your head feels monumental but you shift to inspect to the left. It's a tiny room, just some cabinets and a sink by the door. The air is clean, crisp and smells like the familiar nothing of flawlessly purified indoor air. Comforting, but not helpful in determining where you are. The door is your next course of action. You take a good deep breath and steel yourself to move. You threw your effort into moving your legs and over the bedside they go, more easily than you anticipated. Everything aches but your body still works at least.
</p>
<p>
                Your bare feet were surprisingly warm on the smooth floor and despite your hospital gown attire, you weren’t cold. The air is clean, crisp and smells like the familiar nothing of flawlessly purified indoor air. Comforting, but not helpful in determining where you are. You flattened yourself against the wall opposite the door swing and slowly, silently turned the doorknob, cracking the door open less than an inch.
</p>
<p>
                A black eye stared at you. A chuckle interrupted what you had hoped was stealthy silence. “Good afternoon. I see you’re up and about.”
</p>
<p>
                A young man with a warm expression pulls the door open. He gives you a moment to orient your thoughts, not that you can seem to find any from before your newfound consciousness. He is small and slender but moves confidently past you, pulling the door shut behind him. With an inviting flourish he motions towards the bed raising an expectant eyebrow. Instead of the standard sterilization smocks most medical professionals wear, he opted for a cuffed linen jogger and open cardigan. His black hair hangs long and casual around his face. You accept the invitation, careful to keep the deep relief at being seated again off your face, and sit on the edge of the bed. You couldn’t sneak out if he was standing right there anyway.

              <div id="option3b" style="display:none;">
                <p>It is hard to ignore how your eyes burn as you hastily scan the pale, dim room for any useful information. As you presumed, it was a nondescript hospital room sparsely furnished with merely a few cabinets and no seating beyond the bed you currently occupy. Thick canvas blinds permit narrow slits of daylight, barely illuminating the cramped quarters.
</p>
                <p>A young man with black hair hanging around his face examines a monitoring station at the head of your bed. He looks a bit surprised to see you awake and opens his mouth to greet you when you interject.
</p>
                <p>"What is this place? How long have I been here?" you demand, your parched throat making speech painful. It doesn’t have quite the intimidating effect you were going for. "What happened?" you rasp, slowly rising to assess your physical condition. Though your battered body groans in protest, it is tolerable and you sit up as straight as you can trying to seem less affected than you are.
</p>
                <p>"Well, good afternoon to you too," the man chuckles with infuriating nonchalance, apparently unperturbed by your brusqueness.
