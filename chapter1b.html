                  It was surprisingly quiet. You expected to hear screams, more explosions, people yelling, or alarms at the very least. There was nothing but the ringing in your ears. Just you, crawling down the hallway keeping as low as you can and coughing to expel the smoke from your already abused body. The door beneath the exit sign had a heavy compression bar instead of a door knob and you couldn’t push it in your crouched position. You took as deep a breath as you could of the less smokey air at the ground, stood briefly, and shoved on the door with all your strength. It cracked open just a bit. There was something about the opening mechanism that wasn’t working, you would have to force it. I will not die here. You gave another great heave and the door opened enough for you to squeeze through.
</p><p>
                  The exit was a windowless stairwell all concrete and grey painted steel. Standard stairwell. The air was clean here and you gulped in fresh breaths with the kind of gratitude reserved for the desperate. Stairs ran up and down from your level. A glance back over your shoulder at the door behind you told you whatever unit you had been on was on the fourth floor. You took a stabilizing breath, readied yourself for the flights, stood, and began your descent. The railing was cool and smooth in your hands. By the time you’d made it halfway, you realized there was a wailing siren through the halls behind the stairwell doors of each floor. Either there had been a malfunction on the fourth floor or the explosion had left you temporarily deaf. You tried not to think about what you had missed hearing if it were the latter.
</p><p>
                  By the time you got to the ground floor, exhaustion was creeping into your consciousness. The stairwell had been cool, clean and oddly refreshing but that meant you weren’t in danger. The adrenaline was waning and your body’s poor state was catching you as well as the crash from the adrenaline. All of your aches were trying to come back; you were winning so far in keeping them quelled, but you wouldn’t be for long. The ground floor had only one door on the same wall side all of the other floors had. There was no window. The door felt cool to the touch and there was no smoke coming from around the frame. You pace back and forth contemplating your options when a small placard under the last flight of stairs catches your eye. It was a fire escape map. After a quick scan you realize you aren’t far from an exit to the outside.
</p><p>
                  Just then, the building shakes and a thunderous boom rattles the entire building. The sound is muffled, you assume the assault has to be from either the other side of the building or from above but you felt the reverberations deep in your chest. You couldn’t stay here. You memorized the fire escape path and pushed the door open.
</p><p>
                  This door opened easily and the sirens you had heard through the door assaulted you without a buffer. The light vines overhead had darkened so the strobing emergency lights were the only other illumination aside from the exit signs. This floor was oddly calm. It must have been an administrative section as there were just long hallways with wooden doors in either direction. You went left knowing the exit should be your second right as you left. As you made your way out, you still saw no one. The emptiness was eerie. The door that was supposed to be an exit door was solid. You still hadn’t seen a window since you’d left your room and had to wonder what kind of hospital had no windows anywhere.
</p><p>
                  You take a pause at the exit door. You’re relatively safe where you are. The air is clean, there is no one here, and it seems like whatever is going on outside, is going on further away now. Maybe it would be safer not to go outside. Plus, you haven’t seen anyone. Maybe there is a shelter in the hospital where the staff and patients have evacuated to. The options halt you, a hand on the push bar partly to support your now exhausted body.

<p>
  The pressure bar loosens under your hand through no effort of your own and the door swings away from you swiftly, pulling your support away and causing you to stumble forward. A woman smudged with grime and dust barges through the door nearly barreling into you.
</p><p>
  “Where are the hospital supplies?!” she demands. “There are a lot of hurt people out there and we need help.”
</p><p>
  “I haven’t seen anyone since the doctor I was talking to before the first explosion.”
</p><p>
  “Well, where are they?” Urgency oozes off of her and you get a flash of why behind her.
</p><p>
  Through the open doorway, a flood of sirens, people yelling to one another, the gut wrenching wail of suffering, and the crash of another distant explosion all disturb the peace of the quiet hospital hallway. She’s not a large woman and you can see chaos behind her. There are clusters of people sprinting sporadically and more than a few prone across the lawn around the hospital. The wail you had heard when she opened the door was coming from a figure grasping at one of those prone, the small body limp in their arms.
</p><p>
  “Where are they?!” the woman demands again, dragging your attention away from the horrors behind her.
</p><p>
  “He’s dead.”
</p><p>
  “Oh, well I need to get supplies. Too many people out here need help and it looks like most of the staff are either around front or still inside somewhere. So either move or I’ll move for you.”
</p><p>
  She readies herself to push past you when a blast throws you forward and her backward. Debris flies around you and the detonation roars around you loud and fast then over. Your palms hurt having caught yourself so unexpectedly. A quick look up shows you the brightly lit sunny day of horror you had seen was now shrouded in thick dust, light fighting to get through and nearly everyone splayed out on the grass, some moving but even more lying still. The woman is laid out on her back, face scratched and eyes closed. She must have hit the back of her head in the most recent explosion.
</p><p>
  You look behind you to the hospital and find even more destruction. Ceilings once overhead split open revealing floors and equipment from the levels above. The row of closed doors down the hallway was no longer visible through the extensive damage. It was as if the hospital had crumpled on itself from the top. Minor debris covered your legs but nothing pinned you. If you had been standing just a foot further from the door, you likely would be crushed beneath something. You pulled your legs closer to you and crawled over the woman to ensure you were outside.
</p><p>
  “Seren!” a gruff voice shouted hoarsely from just beyond you. “Damn it, Seren, I told you not to go in there you daft, thick-headed prawn.”
