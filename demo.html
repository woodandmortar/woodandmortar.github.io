    <p>We manage teams of licensed/insured construction personalities ensuring project completion through a transparent communication channel. We offer the “Perfect Bid” which separates every aspect of the construction process down a single nail,
      which allows us to manage projects in-house and as project consultants. </p>
      <p>We’ve heard too many stories of incomplete jobs, or incompetence on the job site. With over 30 years of Residential Construction experience on our team,
       and countless more within our subcontractor structure - there isn’t a project to large to us to handle.</p>
    <blockquote>The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.</blockquote>
    <p>We started in March of 2017, doing every project ourselves with the upmost detail. Building up a solid client list, we are now looking to expand, hire, and train a few more talented individuals to help us achieve our dreams and hopefully create more within our staff.</p>
    <p>Shaping these teams under project management to work more effectively through personal development and communication training, we hope by 2020 to operate as a non-profit focusing on sub-collegiate level students and homeless. We care about our city, and we believe in providing a structured learning environment - allowing paid opportunities with a baseline of moral values that change lives.</p>

      <blockquote>Invest in yourself, by building your dream home - Invest in your city, by creating capable people.</blockquote>
    <p>
The Salmon.fund is designed to help the disenfranchised tackle the barriers that stand between them and
success. We provide the resources to start a remodeling career by giving each participant a smart device
and a vehicle.</p>
<p>The ability to maintain their career is supported with continued training through a
micro-credentials, mCred, online platform and affordable housing. Unfit, vacant properties are acquired
by Salmon.Fund, renovated by the participants through their employment, and given to qualifying
participants to live in upon property completion at a fixed rate rent. From the time the participant receives
their affordable housing to program completion, an estimated four years, the participants will gain trade
experience, finance management assistance, continued education through provided NCCER curriculum,
and internal leadership opportunities. The final incentive is keeping the affordable home with no strings
attached, by which we mean a no mortgage, no rent, full ownership of the home the participant remodeled
and is already living in.</p>
