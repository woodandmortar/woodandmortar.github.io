  <h1>Using your .Fund CARD</h1>
  <p>Activating your digital card usually takes 7-10 business days. Times may vary during US federal holidays and high volume activity. Salmon Fund strongly recommends letting your coins accumulate for a two-year minimum to establish maximum value offsetting all fees. If all funds are immediately withdrawn, a maximum $47.00 USD processing fee will be applied.</p>

Logging into your account and authenticating through Google will allow access to SMN token withdrawls. Your withdrawn funds can be mailed to you via check or instantly deposited onto your digital card. Our digital card allows instant access to your funds but eliminates your account from accumulating AIRDROPs for one(1) tax quarter. Anytime your account holds less than (1000) SMN Tokens you will not be qualified to recieve AIRDROPS for one(1) tax quarter. <br/><br/>

  <p>10 million tokens are in private circulation, providing a “trust” endemic to Wyandotte county.</p>
<br/><br/>
  <p>
    Our app is the SMN token which acts as a public database for all our monetary transactions.
    When we issue a SMN token, it represents 10 cents on the USD. With 10 million in private
    circulation, these tokens are managed in digital wallets and, once distributed, the owner has full
    control of token management. When tokens are in private circulation, they cannot be
    manipulated and only one entity can distribute them from the source. The Salmon Fund holds
    the source wallet with all 10 million tokens and contractually distributes them which creates a
    system of trust.
